# INF2050 // Software Development Tools and Practices

In the INF2050 course, I learn to use key software development tools and practices in a professional setting. I explore agile methods like Scrum, version control with Git, and continuous integration with Maven. I also become familiar with unit testing, code documentation, and refactoring techniques. This course includes team-based practical assignments to provide a hands-on experience of what real software development jobs look like.
